              Different versions of Shakespeare's works have variations in the text because
              each publishing house hired a different group of 'editors' who,
              working primarily with the <a
                href="//sceti.library.upenn.edu/sceti/printedbooksNew/index.cfm?TextID=firstfolio&PagePosition=3"

              >First
Folio of 1623</a>, set to ink their own "interpretation" and
              "improvements" upon the text found in the First Folio.&nbsp; The folio
              is the oldest available <em>full</em>
              printing of the complete works, and is
              closer to how the plays were originally performed.<a href="#*">*</a> The spellings, punctuation (or lack thereof) and other conventions
              used in the folio contain hints for actors which are lost in the later
              versions through "corrections" and other edits made by the editors of
              more recent generations.  This site uses text from <i>The Globe</i>
              editions because that is the text used by the

              The line numbers I've listed in the index of monologues may differ (by up to 10 lines or so) from the hard copy version you have in your home/school/theatre.  This is common as the line numbers vary from edition to edition.

              The search engine on the site is not as advanced as search websites (e.g. Google.) It will look for exactly what you type, including punctuation and spelling. Try removing punctuation, or browse to the page for the play the monologue is from and search there.

            <font size="">
              Alas, no, I cannot.  Only someone who has seen you act can suggest an appropriate monologue to show off the uniqueness that is you. Ask a friend, teacher, director, or someone else who has seen you act in class or in performance.  Perhaps pose the question to your friends on social media.<br /><br />
              If you're not an actor but are required to memorize a monologue for a non-acting class just pick one you've heard of, or one that sounds interesting to you.

I'm not interested in any aspects of the "Authorship Debate" because the question of "who really wrote the plays" is completely irrelevant to acting or directing the plays.  The "lost plays" or "new plays" have become a part of that debate, so to avoid that controversy altogether I stick with the original complete works as published in the <a

            <font size="">
              For the same reason you see ads in the program when you see a play. Production (of any kind) is not free, so I need to try to recover a little bit of the money I lose on this site (by running ads.)<br /><br />
              In the interest of full transparency: Our ad revenue averages about $200 per month during the school year, and about $100 per month in the summer (the best month ever was $500, but that was back before the economy crashed in 2008.) The ad revenue almost covers the costs of creating and maintaining the site. Almost. Sometimes. Your "donations" via the Tip Jar button are much appreciated. (Since the autumn of 2008, donations have totalled less than $100. That's not per year, that's total.)
