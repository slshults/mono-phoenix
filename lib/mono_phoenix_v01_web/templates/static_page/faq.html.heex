              Different versions of Shakespeare's works have variations in the text because
              each publishing house hired a different group of 'editors' who,
              working primarily with the <a

Folio of 1623</a>, set to ink their own "interpretation" and
              "improvements" upon the text found in the First Folio.&nbsp; The folio
              is the oldest available <em>full</em>
              printing of the complete works, and is
              closer to how the plays were originally performed.<a href="#*">*</a> The spellings, punctuation (or lack thereof) and other conventions
              used in the folio contain hints for actors which are lost in the later

              more recent generations.  This site uses text from <i>The Globe</i>

              The line numbers I've listed in the index of monologues may differ (by up to 10 lines or so) from the hard copy version you have in your home/school/theatre.  This is common as the line numbers vary from edition to edition.

              The search engine on the site is not as advanced as search websites (e.g. Google.) The search tool on this site will look for exactly what you type, more or less. Punctuation doesn't matter, but spelling does (note: Elizabethan English had different spellings for many words.)

              Alas, no. I cannot.  Only someone who has seen you act can suggest an appropriate monologue to show off the uniqueness that is you. Ask a friend, teacher, director, or someone else who has seen you act in class or in performance.  Perhaps pose the question to your friends on social media.<br /><br />
              If you're not an actor, but are required to memorize a monologue for a non-acting class, just pick one you've heard of, or one that sounds interesting to you.

I'm not interested in any aspects of the "Authorship Debate" because the question of "who really wrote the plays" is completely irrelevant to acting in, or directing, the plays.  The "lost plays" or "new plays" have become a part of that debate, so to avoid that controversy altogether I stick with the original complete works as published in the <a

              We fully support all forms of gender identity and expression.<br /><br />
              The categories <i>The Men</i>
              and <i>The Women</i>
              refer to the gender of the character in the play. Your gender identity does not need to match that of the character when selecting a monologue from Shakespeare's plays, unless you want it to.<br /><br />
              Remember that in Shakespeare's day all of <i>The Women</i>
              characters were played by men, and 1/5th of his plays include at least one cross-dressing character. It may also be helpful to remember that Shakespeare died in the year 1616, hundreds of years before our modern cultural divides were being fanned by politicians to gain power, and by cable news to increase ad revenue.
              <br /><br />Gender fluidity has been part of the human experience all along, and will always be.

              For the same reason you see ads in the program when you see a play. Production (of any kind) is not free, so I need to try to recover a little bit of the money I lose on this site (by running ads.)<br /><br />
              In the interest of full transparency: Our ad revenue averages about $200 per month during the school year, and about $100 per month in the summer (the best month ever was $500, but that was back before the economy crashed in 2008.) The ad revenue almost covers the costs of creating and maintaining the site. Almost. Sometimes. Your "donations" via the Tip Jar button are much appreciated. (Since the autumn of 2008, donations have totalled less than $200. That's not per year, that's total.)

              We did, for a few years, but it wasn't popular enough to warrant spending time and money to keep it alive, so we let it die. However, you can use the "Add to homescreen" option in Chrome on Android devices, or the "Add to Home Screen" option in Safari on an iPhone.
