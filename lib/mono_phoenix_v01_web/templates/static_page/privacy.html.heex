            If you write to us via that contact form, any personal information you submit to us (names, email addresses etc.) will
            <b>not</b>
            be sold to, shared with, or otherwise divulged to anyone, anywhere, without your express permission, unless we're required to do so by a court warrant. (This also applies to names and email addresses sent to us via the optional Tip Jar, if you choose to put some money in it.)<br /><br />
            We don't have an eNewsletter. We don't send email to users (except to say 'thanks' when someone drops money our Tip Jar, or to reply to email sent via our contact form.) We have no reason to store your email address after we've replied to you, so we'll delete it after we've replied.  See the

Cookies used by the Shakespeare's Monologues website directly are used for site functionality only (e.g. storing your Dark Mode preference, so you don't have to switch to Dark Mode again every time you navigate between pages.)

            We do not send unsolicited commercial email (SPAM.) Ever. Period. In fact, the only emails we ever send to our users are to thank someone for sending us a gratuity via our tip jar, or to reply to messages sent to us via our contact form.

The widget is also displayed to users outside of the US because.<br /><br />
                Fight for the Future is a non-profit organization founded in 2011 whose mission is to ensure that the web continues to hold freedom of expression and creativity at its core.

                - If you view our website without using an <a href="faqs#Q7">adblocker</a>, you'll see ads served by Google, and we use Google Analytics with it. In the interest of full transparency: Our ad revenue averages about $100 per month during the school year, and about $50 per month in the summer (the best month ever was $500, but that was back before the economy crashed in 2008.)  The ad revenue almost covers the costs of creating and maintaining the site. Sometimes.  Your "donations" via the tip jar are much appreciated. (Over the past 5 years, donations have totalled less than $100. That's not per year, that's total.)<br /><br />
